# Write a program to create function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate addition and subtraction. Also, it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call
def calculation(a, b):
    addition = a + b
    subtraction = a - b
    # return multiple values separated by comma
    return addition, subtraction

# get result in tuple format
res = calculation(40, 10)
print(res)
